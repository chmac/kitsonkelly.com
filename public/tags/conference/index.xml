      <description>I got the opportunity to attend TSConf 2018. It was the worlds first focused conference on TypeScript and the lead organiser was my former employer SitePen. We had been batting around a focused conference for an extended period of time, and when Dylan and I visit the TypeScript team about 9 months ago, we figured it was time to pull it together. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to stay around to help make it a reality, but I was glad I could attend to see the outcome.</description>
