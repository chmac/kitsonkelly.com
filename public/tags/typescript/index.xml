      <description>I saw the following tweet from Mohsen:
Creator of Node.js has something cooking here: This is basically Node.js with libuv (and more) swapped with Go IO and network bindings. It has native @typescriptlang support and has a new/better module system https://t.co/oVRlX8vluf
&amp;mdash; Mohsen Azimi (@mohsen____) May 30, 2018  And I got excited. While a TypeScript runtime was never an objective or goal of TypeScript, there is an argument that having a runtime, especially for a server side application, is better.</description>

      <description>I got the opportunity to attend TSConf 2018. It was the worlds first focused conference on TypeScript and the lead organiser was my former employer SitePen. We had been batting around a focused conference for an extended period of time, and when Dylan and I visit the TypeScript team about 9 months ago, we figured it was time to pull it together. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to stay around to help make it a reality, but I was glad I could attend to see the outcome.</description>
