As you might have guessed, this is my personal website.  I am 40 something-ish technologist. I live in Melbourne, though I was born and raised in the US and spent 11 years living in the UK.

I am a recovering 7ft cactus, as during my senior year of high school, I decided to try-out to be our high school mascot, and well, they felt I was qualified enough to crawl into a giant cactus and run around.  Not only did it traumatize me, but also several small children.

These days, I live with my husband. We have been together for about 20 years.

## Tech and Talks

I used to be the project lead for Dojo 2, a web framework focused on making enterprise web application development better.  Currently, I work for Deno Land and am a core contributor to [Deno](https://deno.land/).

I have given a number of talks on various topics over the years, if you are curious:

* One of my first public talks on [Dojo 1.8](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3460-dojo-1-8)
